These designs are then brought into fruition by tailors, professionally equipped and otherwise.

Implementation: An app named 'Dress Your Story' shall be the medium for communication between customers, designers and tailors. After registering (name, phone number, email id, password, payment details), customers can filter the attires depending on occasion, type (ethnic, formals, etc.), articles (bottoms, tops, shirts, etc.), budget, etc. They can also choose on whether they wish a professional designer to work on their designs or whether they wish to opt for a non-professional (students and others). The non-professionals shall have a smaller wage per hour of work than the professionals.

All ideas (abstract or drawn designs, etc) of the customers shall be submitted on the app, reviewed by service personnel (of the 'Dress Your Story' company), redirected to the appropriate designers (designers shall be different based on type and article and depending on the designers' preference and specialisation), checked by the latter wherein advice and opinions shall be provided to the customers. After discussion and contemplation which shall happen through chat, voice calls and video calls, depending on the requirement, between the customers and designers, the design shall be finalized upon, payment done by the customer and sent to tailors hired by the 'Dress Your Story' company. Here, the clothes shall be made in accordance with the restrictions put up by the customers and on completion, shall be delivered to the customers via a collaboration with a transportation service.

Customers can also upload photos of influencers and celebrities wearing the attires for reference.
